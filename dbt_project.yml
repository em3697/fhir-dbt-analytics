# Project variables

vars:
  organization: "Synthea"  # Name of the organization or business unit which owns the FHIR data. Used for titles in the analytics reports. [string]
  database: "bigquery-public-data"  # Name of the Google Cloud project that contains the BigQuery data. Used to connect to your FHIR data. [string]
  schema: "fhir_synthea"  # Name of the BigQuery dataset storing the FHIR data. Used to connect to your FHIR data. [string]
  source_system_default: "Synthea-EHR"  # Default to populate as the 'source_system' in metrics when this is not extracted from the FHIR data. [string]
  site_default: "Synthea General Hospital"  # Default to populate as the 'site' in metrics when this is not extracted from the FHIR data. [string]
  data_transfer_type_default: "BigQuery"  # Default to populate as the 'data_transfer_type' in metrics when this is not extracted from the FHIR data. [string]
  timezone_default: "America/New_York"  # Default time zone for this dataset. The IANA time-zone name. For example, "Europe/London". [string]
  static_dataset: TRUE  # TRUE if the dataset is static; FALSE if the dataset is being dynamically updated. [boolean]
  earliest_date: "2009-10-01"  # If static_dataset = TRUE then input the earliest date for the data. This is used to restrict metric output date ranges. Use format: "YYYY-MM-DD". [string]
  latest_date: "2019-09-23"  # If static_dataset = TRUE then input the latest date for the data. This is used to restrict metric output date ranges. Use format: "YYYY-MM-DD". [string]
  months_history: 12  # For a dynamic dataset (static_dataset = FALSE) the number of months in the past from current_date to include in metric output. [integer]
  persist_all_metric_executions: FALSE  # Whether to enable metric_all model which incrementally adds the output from every execution of the metrics pipeline. [boolean]
  cohort: "all_patients"  # Run metrics for a specific group of patients defined in models/cohorts/. For example, “adults”. Use “all_patients” to disable cohort filtering. [string]

  drop_metric_tables: TRUE  # TRUE to drop intermediate metric tables. Pro: Fewer tables in the dataset. Con: Takes quite a bit of time.
