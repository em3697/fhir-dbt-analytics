# Cohort macros

  - name: get_snapshot_date

    description: |
      Returns the snapshot date declared by the `cohort_snapshot_date` variable.

      If cohort_snapshot_date = 'today', then CURRENT_DATE is returned.


  - name: alive

    description: |
      Evaluates whether a patient was alive on a given date.


  - name: age

    description: |
      Calculates a patient's age on a given date from their date of birth.

      By default this macro will calculate the patient's age as of today's date. If a date is
      specified by the `cohort_snapshot_date` project variable, then the macro will calculate the
      patient's age on that date.

    arguments:
      - name: date_of_birth
        type: string
        description: |
          Patient's date of birth. Default argument is the `birthDate` field from the Patient FHIR
          resource.


  - name: has_encounter

    description: |
      Evaluates whether a patient had an encounter in the past.

      By default the evaluation will be based on today's date, looking back. If a date is specified
      by the `cohort_snapshot_date` project variable, then the macro will only look for encounters
      prior to that date.

    arguments:
      - name: class
        type: list
        description: |
          Restrict the search to a list of specified encounter types as per HL7

      `clinical_code_groups.csv`.

      By default the evaluation will be based on today's date and therefore include condition codes
      recorded up to today. If a date is specified by the `cohort_snapshot_date` project variable,
      then the macro will ignore codes recorded after this snapshot date to determine whether the
      patient had the condition at that time.

    arguments:
      - name: condition
        type: string
        description: |
          Name of the condition as defined in the `group` field within `clinical_code_groups.csv`.

      `clinical_code_groups.csv`.

      By default the evaluation will be based on today's date and therefore include procedure codes
      recorded up to today. If a date is specified by the `cohort_snapshot_date` project variable,
      then the macro will ignore codes recorded after this snapshot date to determine whether the
      patient had the procedure prior to that time.

    arguments:
      - name: procedure
        type: string
        description: |

      `clinical_code_groups.csv`.

      This search can be further refined by evaluating whether the value for that observation was
      above or below a specified value.

      By default the evaluation will be based on today's date and therefore include observation
      codes recorded up to today. If a date is specified by the `cohort_snapshot_date` project
      variable, then the macro will ignore codes recorded after this snapshot date to determine
      whether the patient had the observation prior to that time.

      `clinical_code_groups.csv`.

      By default the evaluation will be based on today's date and therefore include medication
      requests recorded up to today. If a date is specified by the `cohort_snapshot_date` project
      variable, then the macro will ignore medication requests recorded after this snapshot date to
      determine whether the patient had medication requested prior to that time.
