  - name: metric_by_day_dimensions

    description: |
      Creates a SQL view that joins the latest metric outputs (`metric`) with metric metadata
      (`metric_definition`) and groups by source system, metric date and all slices.

      Each row is one metric calculation for a single source system, unique combination of slice
      values, and date.

    tests:
      - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
          expression: "SAFE_DIVIDE(numerator, denominator) = measure"
          condition: "calculation IN ('PROPORTION', 'RATIO')"

    columns:

      - name: calculation
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ["COUNT", "PROPORTION", "RATIO", "DISTRIBUTION"]

      - name: numerator
        tests:
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_null:
              row_condition: "calculation = 'COUNT'"
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null:
              row_condition: "calculation IN ('PROPORTION', 'RATIO')"

      - name: denominator
        tests:
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_null:
              row_condition: "calculation = 'COUNT'"
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null:
              row_condition: "calculation IN ('PROPORTION', 'RATIO')"

      - name: measure
        tests:
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_between:
              min_value: 0
              max_value: 1
              row_condition: "calculation IN ('PROPORTION', 'RATIO')"


  - name: metric_by_day

    description: |
      Creates a SQL view that joins the latest metric outputs (`metric`) with metric metadata
      (`metric_definition`), and groups by source system and metric date.

      Each row in this view is one metric calculation for a single source system and date.


  - name: metric_by_year_dimensions

    description: |
      Creates a SQL view that joins the latest metric outputs (`metric`) with metric metadata
      (`metric_definition`), and groups by source system, metric year and all slices.

      Each row in this view is one metric calculation for a single source system, unique combination
      of slice values and year.


  - name: metric_by_year

    description: |
      Creates a SQL view that joins the latest metric outputs (`metric`) with metric metadata
      (`metric_definition`), and groups by by source system and metric year.

      Each row in this view is one metric calculation for a single source system and year.


  - name: metric_overall

    description: |
      Creates a SQL view that joins the latest metric outputs (`metric`) with metric metadata
      (`metric_definition`), and groups by source system only.

      Each row in this view is one metric calculation for a single source system over the entire
      analysis period.
