  - name: metric_by_slices_system_date

    description: |
      SQL view that joins the latest metric outputs (`metric`) with metric metadata
      (`metric_definition`).

      Each row is one metric calculation for a single source system, unique combination of slice
      values, and local date.

    tests:
      - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
          expression: "SAFE_DIVIDE(numerator, denominator) = measure"
          condition: "calculation IN ('PROPORTION', 'RATIO')"

    columns:

      - name: calculation
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ["COUNT", "PROPORTION", "RATIO", "DISTRIBUTION"]

      - name: numerator
        tests:
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_null:
              row_condition: "calculation = 'COUNT'"
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null:
              row_condition: "calculation IN ('PROPORTION', 'RATIO')"

      - name: denominator
        tests:
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_null:
              row_condition: "calculation = 'COUNT'"
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null:
              row_condition: "calculation IN ('PROPORTION', 'RATIO')"

      - name: measure
        tests:
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_between:
              min_value: 0
              max_value: 1
              row_condition: "calculation IN ('PROPORTION', 'RATIO')"


  - name: metric_by_system_date

    description: |
      Creates a SQL view that joins the latest metric outputs (`metric`) with metric metadata
      (`metric_definition`), and aggregates by source system and metric date.

      Each row in this view is one metric calculation for a single source system and local date.


  - name: metric_by_system

    description: |
      Creates a SQL view that joins the latest metric outputs (`metric`) with metric metadata
      (`metric_definition`), and aggregates by metric date.

      Each row in this view is one metric calculation for a single source system over the entire
      analysis period.
